/*
Switch statement
Demonstrates the use of a switch statement. The switch statement allows you
to choose from among a set of discrete values of a variable. It's like a
series of if statements.
To see this sketch in action, put the board and sensor in a well-lit room,
open the Serial Monitor, and move your hand gradually down over the sensor.
The circuit:
- photoresistor from analog in 0 to +5V
- 10K resistor from analog in 0 to ground
